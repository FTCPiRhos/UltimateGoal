         * Overview of what we're doing:
         *
         * We first convert to YCrCb color space, from RGB color space.
         * Why do we do this? Well, in the RGB color space, chroma and
         * luma are intertwined. In YCrCb, chroma and luma are separated.
         * YCrCb is a 3-channel color space, just like RGB. YCrCb's 3 channels
         * are Y, the luma channel (which essentially just a B&W image), the
         * Cr channel, which records the difference from red, and the Cb channel,
         * which records the difference from blue. Because chroma and luma are
         * not related in YCrCb, vision code written to look for certain values
         * in the Cr/Cb channels will not be severely affected by differing
         * light intensity, since that difference would most likely just be
         * reflected in the Y channel.
         *
         * After we've converted to YCrCb, we extract just the 2nd channel, the
         * Cb channel. We do this because stones are bright yellow and contrast
         * STRONGLY on the Cb channel against everything else, including SkyStones
         * (because SkyStones have a black label).
         *
         * We then take the average pixel value of 3 different regions on that Cb
         * channel, one positioned over each stone. The brightest of the 3 regions
         * is where we assume the SkyStone to be, since the normal stones show up
         * extremely darkly.
         *
         * We also draw rectangles on the screen showing where the sample regions
         * are, as well as drawing a solid rectangle over top the sample region
         * we believe is on top of the SkyStone.
         *
         * In order for this whole process to work correctly, each sample region
         * should be positioned in the center of each of the first 3 stones, and
         * be small enough such that only the stone is sampled, and not any of the
         * surroundings.
